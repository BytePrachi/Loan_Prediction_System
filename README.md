This project aims to make it easier for lenders to decide who gets a loan by cleaning up and analyzing applicant information. Here, I am using some machine learning models to predict who is likely to be eligible for a loan based on their details. The goal is to create a straightforward and fair system that helps both lenders and applicants in the loan approval process.
